# Computer-Price-Analysis
I have made a ML Project for Predicting Prices of Computer . I have used Multiple Linear Regression , AdaBoost, XG Boost , Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN.
I have used variables like Speed of Processor , RAM size , Hard Disk Size , CD Player present or not as inputs to predict the Target Variable.
